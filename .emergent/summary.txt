<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a professional website called TwinzCard for selling gift cards.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Business Model:** It's an affiliate site. The website will only display the gift cards. When a user clicks to pay, they will be redirected to the supplier's website. No payment processing will happen on this site.
2.  **Design:** A professional dark theme with orange as an accent color.
3.  **Internationalization:** The site must support both English and Arabic, with a language switching option.
4.  **Content & Pages:**
    *   A home page displaying all available gift cards.
    *   Individual detail pages for each card type (5 types initially).
    *   A Buy Now button should ONLY be on the card detail page, not the home page.
    *   Legal pages: Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions.
    *   An Instructions page.
5.  **Card Functionality:**
    *   On the card detail page, users should be able to select a value (e.g., 0, 0).
    *   For cards that apply to different regions, users must be able to select the account type (e.g., US or Qatari account).
6.  **Branding:** A specific logo provided by the user should be displayed in the header, footer, and on the home page.
7.  **Responsiveness:** The website must be fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices, specifically iPhones.
8.  **Deployment & Domain:** The user wants the code pushed to a GitHub repository and wants to link their custom domain  to the live application.
9.  **Font Customization:** Use professional-looking fonts for both English and Arabic text across all pages.
10. **Footer Content:** The Follow Us section (with social media icons) and the Made in Qatar text must be removed from the footer.

**User's preferred language**: Arabic (العربية)

**what currently exists?**
A complete React-based frontend application has been built. It includes a home page, card detail pages, legal pages, and full support for English and Arabic languages via . The design is a dark theme with orange accents as requested. The application is responsive and has been optimized for mobile views. The user flow where the Buy Now button is only on the detail page is implemented. The requested logo has been integrated, and the footer has been cleaned up as per the user's request. The code is ready but has some pending tasks and potential deployment issues.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The user made three concurrent requests: 1) Change fonts for English and Arabic. 2) Link the custom domain . 3) Fix deployment issues. The agent focused on the deployment aspect, invoking the deployment agent. The last logs showed a successful deployment, but the user was still asking about it, and the other two tasks were not started.
- Status: BLOCKED
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? manual testing by curl
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Potential recurring deployment failure (P0)**

    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent was called with deployment logs showing a MongoDB  error. The agent incorrectly assumed this was due to missing  files. Later, another deployment log showed success, but the user is still asking about deployment, indicating the problem might not be resolved or is intermittent.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify that the production environment variables (, ) are correctly configured for the production Atlas MongoDB instance, not the sandboxed one.
        2.  Check the deployment logs again for any new or recurring authentication errors.
        3.  Confirm with the user if they have provided the correct production database credentials.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The application cannot be successfully and reliably deployed to production without resolving the database connection issue.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** backend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** User confirmation of production credentials.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **Task 1: Implement Custom Fonts (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** Modify  to import and apply professional fonts for both English and Arabic. For Arabic, a font like 'Cairo' or 'Tajawal' could be used. For English, a font like 'Poppins' or 'Montserrat'. Update the  and specific element CSS to use these fonts.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** Fulfill the user's request for a more professional and customized look and feel.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend

  - **Task 2: Guide User on Domain Linking (P1)**
    - **Where to resume:** The agent needs to provide clear, step-by-step instructions to the user.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** Help the user connect their  domain to the deployed application.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** NA

  - **Task 3: Push Code to GitHub (P2)**
    - **Where to resume:** Guide the user on how to use the Save to GitHub feature or perform a manual .
    - **What will be achieved with this?** The project source code will be version-controlled and backed up on GitHub as requested.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** NA

**Completed work in this session**
- **Recently completed:**
  - **Base Project Setup:** Created a full React application structure.
  - **UI/UX:** Implemented a dark theme with orange accents.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Code Fragility in **
    -   **Debug checklist:** The  component caused the application to crash multiple times with Babel/compilation errors when new logic was added. The fixes involved significant code simplification.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** The component should be refactored to be more robust and maintainable. This will prevent future crashes when adding new features.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** frontend
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** 
-   **Recurrence count:** 1
-   **Status:** BLOCKED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React.js
-   **Routing:** 
-   **Internationalization (i18n):**  and  for English and Arabic language support.
-   **Styling:** CSS with media queries for responsiveness.
-   **Deployment:** The user is attempting to use Emergent deployments to Kubernetes.

**key DB schema**
N/A. This is a frontend-only application and does not have a database schema.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Core page for displaying card details and handling user selections. Has been a source of instability.
-   : The main landing page that displays the gift cards.
-   : The site's navigation header, contains the language switcher and logo.
-   : The site's footer, which was recently modified.
-   , : Global styles and responsiveness rules.
-   , : Files controlling the bilingual functionality.
-   : Main HTML file where viewport meta tag was added.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   ****: This component has been repeatedly patched to fix compilation errors. It is brittle and should be refactored to be more stable and easier to maintain, especially the state management for card value and account type selection.

**key api endpoints**
N/A. The application is frontend only and does not define any backend APIs.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Top Priority:** The user's main concerns are deployment and linking their custom domain (). Do not assume deployment is fixed, even if one log showed success. The previous MongoDB authentication error is a major red flag that production credentials might be wrong.
2.  **Pending User Requests:** The user has explicitly asked for new fonts and to have the project pushed to GitHub. These tasks are not started.
3.  **Code Instability:** Be cautious when modifying the  component. It has a history of causing compilation errors. Refactoring it should be considered.
4.  **Language:** The user's primary language is Arabic. All communications should be in Arabic.
